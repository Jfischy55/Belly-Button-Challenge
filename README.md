# Belly-Button-Challenge

Clone repo to new folder.

Access Start_Code_Att_2.

I was finally able to get the panel to work, however I can't seem to get my graphs to appear and populate correctly.

The first Starter_Code folder was my first attempt, but I couldn't fix it and decided to just start over.

I did some searching online to try to figure out where I was going wrong, that's what Starter_Code_Att_2 is.

I was able to get at least one aspect of it working but I can't seem to get the rest to work properly, so I'm waiving the white flag and submitting what I have.

In the first attempt I was struggling to try to have both chart functions with one function, so in the second I just separated them, but was still unable to get it to work correctly.
